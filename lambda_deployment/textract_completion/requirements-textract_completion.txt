# Textract Completion Lambda - Runtime Dependencies
# Optimized: Only runtime deps needed (no Strands, Jinja2, testing tools, agents)
#
# This lambda is self-contained and doesn't depend on agents/shared
# It only needs core AWS SDKs and structured logging
#
# Generated: 2026-02-09
# Python: 3.12+ (AWS Lambda supports 3.12, 3.13, 3.14)

# AWS SDKs
boto3>=1.42.43              # AWS SDK for Python
botocore>=1.42.24           # Low-level AWS service library (required by boto3)

# Structured Logging
structlog>=25.5.0           # Production-grade structured logging
python-json-logger>=4.0.0   # JSON formatter for structured logs

# Notes:
# - boto3 includes botocore as a dependency
# - structlog is used for consistent logging across the system
# - This lambda does NOT use:
#   * Strands AI SDK (not needed for document processing)
#   * Jinja2 (not rendering templates)
#   * pydantic (not validating external input shapes)
#   * email-validator (not parsing emails)
#   * agents/shared modules (standalone lambda)
