    "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out about the satellite upgrade project.\n\nI do have a bucket truck available (2021 Ford F-550 with Altec boom) and I'm experienced with satellite installations.\n\nHowever, I should be upfront - I don't currently have a spectrum analyzer. I've been meaning to invest in one but haven't made the purchase yet. I do have fiber splicing equipment and an OTDR if those would be useful.\n\nWould this be a deal-breaker for the project, or is there any flexibility on the equipment requirements?\n\nI can provide my insurance certificate if there's a chance to move forward.\n\nThanks,\nSarah Johnson\nField Tech Services",
