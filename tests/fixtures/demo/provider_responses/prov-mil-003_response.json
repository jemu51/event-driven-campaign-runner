    "body": "Good morning!\n\nI'd like to participate in the satellite upgrade project.\n\nMy equipment includes:\n- Spectrum analyzer (Anritsu MS2721B)\n- Cable tester (Fluke CableIQ)\n- OTDR (EXFO MaxTester)\n\nI should note that I don't currently have a bucket truck - I usually rent one for aerial work. Would that be acceptable?\n\nI'm CompTIA Network+ certified and hold an FCC license. Willing to travel throughout the Midwest.\n\nI'm attaching my insurance certificate. Please let me know if additional documentation is needed.\n\nRegards,\nKevin Murphy\nMidwest Solutions\n(920) 555-0987",
